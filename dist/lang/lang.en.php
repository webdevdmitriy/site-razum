    <br>‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ Industry 4.0 or fourth industrial revolution - involves
    the advanced approach to production. It is based on massive introduction into information
    technology in the industry, large-scale automation of business processes and the spread of
    artificial intelligence.<br>
    <br>‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ Artificial intelligence opens new opportunities for
    industry that were previously unavailable. Analytics and data manipulation allows AI to build
    product models and monitor processes in real time, control product quality, and implement
    predictive analytics.<br>
    <br>‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ The main purpose of AI in industry is intelligent process
    control. It allows to improve the existing production indicators, save resources and stabilize
    the quality of products.<br>
    <br>‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ Following the trend of Industry 4.0 the concept of "Razum"
    was created. It defines the approach to the development and implementation of software and
    hardware technological solutions. <br>
    <br>‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ "Razum" calculates and predicts the behavior of
    technological parameters. Based on the calculations, the system provides the definition of tasks
    for the control actions of local control loops. These tasks are transferred to regulators on the
    control system.<br>
    <br>‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ Automatic control of technological processes occurs on the
    basis of a dynamic model of the technological parameters of the equipment. In order to do it in
    the technological chain for each piece of equipment, a model with a high degree of information
    is created. Those models are digital twins, which are based on systems of mathematical
    equations. These solutions are compares favorably with high accuracy of 96% and promptness of
    implementation.<br>
    <br>‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ In order to implement "Razum" into a specific object the
    following steps shell be carried out:<br>

    <br>‍ ‍ ‍ ‍● Survey - analysis of the operation current mode and
    following identification of restrictions;<br>
    <br>‍ ‍ ‍ ‍● Integration - changing the software of programmable logic
    controllers and human-machine interface, restructuring existing control loops;<br>
    <br>‍ ‍ ‍ ‍● Activation - setting up digital twins and configuring the
    technological chain;<br>
    <br>‍ ‍ ‍ ‍● Testing - checking the compliance with target functions,
    fine-tuning software, staff training and commissioning. <br>

    <br>
    <br>‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ "Razum" increases the productivity, reduces the costs and
    stabilizes the quality of products.<br>
